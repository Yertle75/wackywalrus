# Wacky Walrus

WackyWalrus is a Firefox extension that allow me to surf the internet peacefully by removing all the eye candy on the pages I regularly browse. 
It's almost surely completely useless for you but you might get some inspiration from it if you want to do the same thing.

## Installation :
Download the .xpi file and go to Addon > Install addon from file or something alike

Warning: The xpi might not be at the latest version possible, so to build from source, download all the files, zip them and go to the mozilla addon manager to sign it.
```
zip -r -FS ../wackywalrus.zip *
```
